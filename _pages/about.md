Welcome! I’m a political theorist who writes about political economy, democracy, and social theory. My current book project and recent research focus on the politics of money and wealth. I also study how finance intersects with mass incarceration, race, and gender. Some of this work has been published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00905917231204891" class="pink-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Political Theory</em></a> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591720980472" class="no-pink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also here</a>), <em>Daedalus</em> (forthcoming), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592721002218" class="pink-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Perspectives on Politics</em></a>, and the <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cg3q309" class="pink-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>UCLA Criminal Justice Law Review</em></a>.
