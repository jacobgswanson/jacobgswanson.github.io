Welcome! I'm a political theorist who writes about political economy, democracy, and social theory. My book project and much of my recent work focus on the politics of money. Other research looks at the intersection of finance, mass incarceration, race, and gender.

Some of this work has been published in [*Political Theory*](https://doi.org/10.1177/00905917231204891) ([also here](https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591720980472)), *Daedalus* (forthcoming), [*Perspectives on Politics*](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592721002218), and the [*UCLA Criminal Justice Law Review*](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cg3q309).
