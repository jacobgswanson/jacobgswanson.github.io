Welcome! Iâ€™m a political theorist who writes about political economy, democracy, and social theory. My current book project and recent research focus on the politics of money and wealth. I also study how finance intersects with mass incarceration, race, and gender. Some of this work has been published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00905917231204891" style="text-decoration:none; border-bottom: 2px solid #ff69b4;">*Political Theory*</a> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591720980472">also here</a>), *Daedalus* (forthcoming), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592721002218" style="text-decoration:none; border-bottom: 2px solid #ff69b4;">*Perspectives on Politics*</a>, and the <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cg3q309" style="text-decoration:none; border-bottom: 2px solid #ff69b4;">*UCLA Criminal Justice Law Review*</a>.
