### Projects

A second major book-length project, provisionally entitled _Democracy's Debts_, offers a historical exploration of the democratic politics of debt in North America since the eighteenth century. The work examines how debt discourse has been mobilized both to entrench hierarchy and to imagine struggles for equality across four key arenas: public debt politics, credit's role in slavery and reparations demands, progressive versus regressive distribution, and personal/metaphorical debt. The first paper from this project, "Hamilton's Debt: On the Ideological Origins of Public Debt and Private Credit Markets," (noted below), is currently in preparation for journal submission.
